# End Thoughts
This is a purely luck based simulation. Whether you win or loose is based on the random numbers generated by the SecureRandom Class of java.security package. So your fate is decided by a random number generating class of java which is fair as in real life also playing this game with a book is purely luck based. But we humans are intelligent. We can always get an idea of how many pages to flip to get good score after playing for sometime with a particular book!!!
